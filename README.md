Visualizing Data with Leaflet

The USGS provides scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS provided earthquake data is available at (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) 

A map is created using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.

The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.

The map includes popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

A legend provides context for the map data.
